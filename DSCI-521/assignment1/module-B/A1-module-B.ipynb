    "\n",
    "Key word in context (KWiC) is a common format for concordance lines, i.e., contextualized instances of principal words used in a book. More generally, KWiC is essentially the concept behind the utility of 'find in page' on document viewers and web browsers. This module builds up a KWiC utility for finding key word-containing sentences, and 'most relevant' paragraphs, quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "__B1.__ _(3 points)_ Start by writing a function called `load_book` that reads in a book based on a provided `book_id` string and returns a list of `paragraphs` from the book. When book data is loaded, you should remove the space characters at the beginning and end of the text (e.g., using `strip()`). Then, to split books into paragraphs, use the `re.split()` method to split the input in cases where there are two or more new lines. Note, that books are in the provided `data/books` directory.\n",
